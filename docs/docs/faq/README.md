# FAQ

## Why is a BC Government Project OpenSource?

Historically BC Government projects were owned by the crown and kept _secret_. The current stance is that citizens should have access to tax payer funded developments. Making these projects open source makes it easier for other jurisdictions to use and contribute enhancements back! It also provides the opportunity to stimulate the tech community and encourage sharing across all broader public sector entities.
