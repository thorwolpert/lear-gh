# Wardley Map

A Wardley map is a map of the structure of a business or service, mapping the components needed to serve the customer or user.

The Entity's Team created the following WardleyMap to help rationalize the business services needed to meet the needs of the modern Registry.

"However, all models are wrong but some are useful." -- Simon Wardley

## Pro-Customers

Professional Customers are ones that use the LEAR API directly, as opposed to using the Citizen facing applications.

As the Registry believes in _eating your own dog food_, the Registry itself is a pro-customer and uses the APIs for its citizen facing applications.
